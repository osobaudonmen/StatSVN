We are pleased to announce the StatCVS 0.6.0 release! http://statcvs.sf.net 

StatCVS retrieves information from a CVS repository and generates various tables and charts describing the project development, 
e.g. timeline for the lines of code, contribution of each developer etc. The current version of StatCVS generates a static 
suite of HTML documents containing tables and chart images. StatCVS is open source software, released under the terms of 
the LGPL. StatCVS uses JFreeChart and JTreeMap to generate charts.
